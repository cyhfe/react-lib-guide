This course is written with flexibility in mind. The lessons are recorded in a MacOS environment, but all examples are applicable for Windows, and Linux environments as well.

## GitHub account

We will be creating private repositories and packages within GitHub during this course. If you don't have a GitHub account, [create one here](https://github.com/join). If you haven't authenticated GitHub locally, you can [configure SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

All GitHub usage will be within their [free tier](https://github.com/pricing).

## Node.js and NPM

During this course we will be using the latest release of Node.js, `v16.x`. We will also be using the latest version of NPM, `v7.x`. If your organization uses yarn, all examples are compatible with yarn `v1`.

Check your current versions by running:

```bash
node -v # should return v16.x.x
npm -v # should return v7.x.x
```

If you don't have the correct versions installed, view the platform-specific [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required for this course. Follow these platform-specific [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Editor

If you don't have a preferred code editor, I recommend installing [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Reporting errors

If you see an error, a typo, or any other issue, send an email to [us@fullstack.io](mailto:us@fullstack.io) with the issue and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
